					   <p> There is an Art gallery about the journey of cricket and its history . Documentaries are also played about the life and journey of legendry crickters.
                          Clients are able to view paintings in situ and, seeing fine art hanging over an abandoned coffee cup or the odd half chewed sneaker 
						  — the pervasive art of domestic life — seemed to make visitors immediately at ease with the paintings and able imaginatively to transmit 
						  them to their own houses. Consequently, this feeling of seeing art hang “at home” is a concept rooted in the design of her galleries, 
						  and each has the welcoming feeling of a furnished house rather than the more traditional spare, minimalistc design of most galleries.
						  </p>

				  <img  class="ww"src="cric2.jpg" alt="cricket">
			
		      	<p>  Cricket has a rich history dating back in 17th century . 
                    In 1788, the first official laws of cricket were written, and terms like middle stump and lbw were coined. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was the first cricket team,
                    and they played on the Lord’s field in England. In 1793, the first recorded game of cricket was played at the Lord’s ground.
                    International games, or professional cricket matches, played by one country against another country; have been happening since 1844. Cricket was introduced to North 
                     America by the English colonies. The British India Company’s invasion over India had brought cricket to India and its neighboring countries.	For further
