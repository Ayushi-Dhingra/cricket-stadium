				      <h4 > GALLERY     </h4>
                     <img class="gall" src="cric13.jpg" alt="gallery">					 
					  
					   <p> There is an Art gallery about the journey of cricket and its history . Documentaries are also played about the life and journey of legendry crickters.
                          Clients are able to view paintings in situ and, seeing fine art hanging over an abandoned coffee cup or the odd half chewed sneaker 
						  — the pervasive art of domestic life — seemed to make visitors immediately at ease with the paintings and able imaginatively to transmit 
						  them to their own houses. Consequently, this feeling of seeing art hang “at home” is a concept rooted in the design of her galleries, 
						  and each has the welcoming feeling of a furnished house rather than the more traditional spare, minimalistc design of most galleries.
						  </p>
					   
					  
					  
					  
					  <h4 > LIVE AQAURIUM  </h4>
					  <img class="aqua" src="cric14.jpg" alt="aqaurium">
					   
					  
					  <p> Witness the world's biggest live aqaurium . It connects you stariaght to the nature and feel your connection with the ocean . You can probably see every
                         sea creature if you spent some time here . </p>
